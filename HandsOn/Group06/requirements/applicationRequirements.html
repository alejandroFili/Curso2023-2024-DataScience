<p>The purpose of our application is to offer our users different
parking lots in Paris close to their location. To carry out this service,
we linked two datasets(parking locations and streets in Paris).</p>
<p>To offer our user a more complete service, our application could
potentially offer different information such as opening and closing time
or even the cost per hour. Furthermore, users will be able to filter the
parking lots depending on their proximity(radius search) and their
opening hours.</p>
