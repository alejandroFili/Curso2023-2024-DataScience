Especies predominantes  Una treintena de parterres, distribuidos en siete plazas, conforman el botánico en el que hay una buena representación de 22 familias vegetales como las palmáceas, leguminosas, labiadas u oleáceas y hasta 180 especies diferentes de árboles y arbustos. En la actualidad se pueden observar 145 árboles, 25 palmáceas, 14.500 arbustos, 1.500 plantas tapizantes, otras 1.100 de flor y 400 rosales. Entre unas y otras zonas se asoman a los paseos desde los ejemplares más tradicionales y propios de los suelos castellanos hasta plantas originales y curiosas, como las acacias retinoides, que son de hoja perenne. No faltan frondosos parterres de coníferas, ni los robles o encinas. Hay también membrilleros e higueras y entre árbol y árbol se dejan ver arbustos como el madroño, la celinda, el berberis o el aligustre, además del tomillo, el romero, la salvia, la santolina o la lavanda. Otras de las especies señalizadas en este botánico son los arces, sauces, alcornoques, avellanos o cedros. Árboles, plantas y arbustos están acompañados de un cartel explicativo con la ficha correspondiente en la que se puede conocer el origen de la especie, la altura que alcanza, el tipo de hoja y la época de floración. Un texto con una imagen ilustrativa da más pistas sobre la historia, los usos o las propiedades del vegetal en cuestión." .

El recinto albergaba también los talleres municipales, responsables de los trabajos de albañilería, carpintería, cerrajería y fontanería necesarios para los Parques y Jardines de Madrid. A lo largo del siglo XIX se construyeron diversos invernaderos e instalaciones, la mayoría de los cuales se conservan en la actualidad. El vivero posee una colección de 19 invernaderos antiguos únicos en la España actual, además de 4 invernaderos de diseño moderno. Se conservan en el recinto otras instalaciones como cajoneras y calderas antiguas. Existe además una colección de aperos e instrumentos de cultivo que en breve será expuesta en uno de los invernaderos antiguos." .

En virtud de dicho Decreto, los terrenos de la Casa de Campo y del Campo del Moro fueron cedidos al Ayuntamiento de Madrid para ser destinados a parques de recreo e instrucción.   En 2010 se declara Bien de Interés Cultural, en la categoría de Sitio Histórico. La Casa de Campo constituye actualmente el principal pulmón de la ciudad y alberga numerosas actividades ligadas a su finalidad como lugar de recreo e instrucción de los ciudadanos.  A su valor ecológico y paisajístico se suma una importante carga histórica, materializada en significativos restos arqueológicos, un conjunto de edificaciones y obra civil de carácter histórico-monumental, testimonio de su etapa como Real Sitio y una amplia representación de arquitecturas contemporáneas de su etapa como parque público.  Parque histórico de carácter principalmente forestal de gran extensión con un relieve ondulado de suaves pendientes en el que sobresalen pequeños cerros, surcado por pequeños valles por donde discurren algunos arroyos permanentes y otros estacionales que confluyen en el río Manzanares. La mayoría tienen su nacimiento dentro del Parque, si bien los dos más importantes, Antequina y Meaques, nacen fuera del mismo. Entre las láminas de agua cabe destacar la del Lago y varias charcas artificiales para hábitat y alimentación de la fauna.  Varios recintos de gestión independiente se encuentran en su interior: entre otros el Parque de Atracciones, Parque Zoológico, Recinto Ferial, Venta del Batán y el Club de Campo.  En su vegetación destacan encinares, vegetación potencial del Parque, retamares, fresnedas, olmedas, bosquetes de ribera y las repoblaciones de pinos y arizónicas. En algunas zonas la encina empieza a emerger iniciando un proceso natural de sustitución del pinar.

La Antigua Casa de la Moneda y el Timbre ocupaba estos terrenos hasta los años 70, fecha en la que se remodeló la plaza y se crearon los jardines y el antiguo Centro Cultural de la Villa. En la actualidad es un lugar de referencia para los madrileños ya que su excelente ubicación los convierte en uno de los principales escenarios para la celebración de todo tipo de eventos: actos de conmemoración del Día de la Hispanidad, ferias, manifestaciones y encuentros deportivos.  El diseño original  de la jardinería  presentaba grandes áreas geométricas de césped en la zona  central de la plaza, acompañadas de macizos de flor y ejemplares arbóreos de gran porte como pinos, cipreses y magnolios en las franjas laterales. Debido a las filtraciones producidas en las instalaciones subterráneas y al gasto de agua para su mantenimiento, en 2006 las praderas se sustituyeron por grava ornamental. En la actualidad bajo su superficie se encuentran el aparcamiento público Plaza de Colón y el Fernán Gómez Centro Cultural de la Villa.  Los Jardines del Descubrimiento deben su nombre a Cristóbal Colón. Un gran monumento neogótico con la estatua de Cristóbal Colón ha presidido los jardines desde 1972 a 2009, año en el que con motivo de las obras de remodelación del eje Prado-Recoletos fue de nuevo trasladado a la que fuera su ubicación inicial, el centro de la rotonda de la plaza de Colón. En el lateral de la calle Serrano se sitúa el Monumento al Descubrimiento de América compuesto por cuatro grandes bloques de hormigón con grabados y textos de la historia del Descubrimiento. En estos céntricos jardines ondea desde 2002 la bandera más grande de España, con 294 metros cuadrados -21 x 14- de longitud y 35 kilos de peso. Está sostenida por un mástil de 50 metros de altura que gira en la dirección del viento lo que impide que se enrolle. Mirando a esta bandera se colocó en 2014 una estatua en honor al almirante Blas de Lezo.  Otras denominaciones: Jardines de la Plaza Colón" .

Las asociaciones de vecinos del barrio de Villa Rosa participaron en el diseño de esta zona verde de 5 hectáreas. El parque Villa Rosa-Paco Caño ofrece numerosos atractivos entre los que destaca una ría que recorre longitudinalmente la superficie y que puede cruzarse por cualquiera de los nueve puentes. La ría nace en el reloj de sol horizontal de piedra artificial con gnomon de acero y finaliza en el palomar. A lo largo del parque se pueden observar diversos elementos singulares como la casa derrumbada. Estas ruinas son  una alegoría de un edificio bombardeado y en su interior se alza un monumento con una placa con la efigie de Enrique Tierno Galván. Muy próximo se sitúa el templete como homenaje a la tranquilidad. En 2016 se inauguró el primer circuito inclusivo en la Comunidad de Madrid con recorridos señalizados y adaptados para personas con diversidad funcional.

Los recorridos están señalizados y adaptados para personas en sillas de ruedas, sordas, ciegas o con problemas intelectuales o de movilidad.  Desde octubre de 2016 el parque se llama Villa Rosa-Paco Caño, en homenaje al histórico dirigente vecinal Paco Caño, presidente de la Federación Regional de Asociaciones de Vecinos de Madrid (FRAVM y fundador de la asociación de vecinos Villa Rosa.

El ajardinamiento se caracteriza por la presencia de masas de arbustos acompañados de árboles de gran porte, arbolado original de la zona verde y un entramado de caminos que conectan distintas zonas estanciales y áreas infantiles.     TRAMO 2. Entre la calle Golondrina y el límite con el pueblo de Pozuelo. Esta fase se desarrolló solo en la ribera norte del arroyo. En este caso, salvo una zona ajardinada alrededor de una fuente ornamental, el diseño es mucho más forestal con plantaciones de arbolado de diversas especies. También hay zonas infantiles y para mayores, zonas estanciales y pistas deportivas.   FASE 3_ PARQUE. ARROYO POZUELO (AMPLIACIÓN) 2: tercera fase actualmente en desarrollo (iniciada en 2015), entre la calle Golondrina y el límite con el pueblo de Pozuelo, en la ribera sur del arroyo.

Antiguamente era el lugar de recreo de los distintos propietarios del palacio contiguo. El jardín aún conserva su estructura original, pese a haber sido reformado en varias ocasiones. Los caminos de ladrillos están aparejados a sardinel (albañilería hecha con los ladrillos colocados de canto, en posición vertical, adosados por sus caras). Dentro del jardín destacan varios arbustos singulares y una gran pérgola de rosales trepadores. El Jardín original data aproximadamente del año 1750. Su aspecto actual se debe al encargo que en 1920 realizaron los Marqueses de la Romana al pintor y diseñador de jardines Javier de Winthuysen. La última restauración la realizó la paisajista toscana Lucía Serredi en el año 2002." .

Todo ello presidido por un imponente palacio con sus caballerizas. En la Quinta se pueden encontrar hasta 58 especies diferentes de árboles y arbustos, algunos tan singulares como una encina de más de 300 años y ejemplares de almendros, pinos y cedros de importantes dimensiones. Su última propietaria, Tatiana Pérez de Guzmán el Bueno, firmó junto a su marido el 15 julio de 1986, un convenio de permuta por el cual la finca pasaba a ser propiedad del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, pero manteniéndose en usufructo hasta el fallecimiento de la condesa, ocurrido el primero de octubre de 2012.

Las diferencias de nivel existentes entre la calle Fresnedillas y el fondo de la vaguada y entre ésta y el carril bici se salvan con hileras de gaviones (muros de contención realizados con piedras retenidas con malla de alambre). Estos muros que suavizan las pendientes y evitan las escorrentías crean espacios, casi planos entre ellos, donde se han realizado las plantaciones. En la zona baja de la parcela se localiza un bosquete de fresnos, por donde en su día discurría el arroyo del Fresno. También se han plantado alineaciones arbóreas y arbustivas y parterres con plantas de temporada y aromáticas. El parque tiene instalado riego por goteo y se ha dotado la zona con alumbrado público. Cada área dispone de su mobiliario específico con bancos corridos sobre los gaviones y papeleras.

Su diseño inicial es obra del reconocido arquitecto japonés, premio Priztker 2013, Toyo Ito, el cual fue completado y modificado por otro procedente de un proceso participativo de la ciudadanía. De marcado carácter oriental, su paisaje está formado por suaves colinas donde destacan bosquetes de árboles de varias especies, entre los que predominan álamos blancos, membrilleros, encinas o chopos negros, y una ría central jalonada por macizos de arbustos como rosales silvestres, mimbreras y otras especies de ribera. El Ayuntamiento ha llevado a cabo la rehabilitación de esta zona verde en dos fases. La primera, que finalizó en enero de 2018, incluyó el cerramiento de todo el parque para proteger su singularidad, la reposición de plantaciones y elementos deteriorados por el vandalismo, la instalación de red de riego telegestionada, la acometida de agua regenerada y mejoras en pavimentación y drenaje. La segunda fase, finalizada en 2021, comprende la totalidad del parque. El proyecto ha tenido en cuenta las propuestas vecinales recogidas en el proceso participativo llevado a cabo por las asociaciones vecinales. El parque consta, entre otros elementos, de 3.322 árboles, 170.742 unidades arbustivas, 7.460 m2 de césped y 36.000 m2 de pradera natural. Además se ha construido 1 área canina, 4 áreas infantiles y 9 zonas deportivas, dotadas todas ellas de nuevos elementos de juego. Se ha instalado igualmente el mobiliario urbano necesario para el disfrute de los usuarios, formado por papeleras, bancos, fuentes de beber, red de alumbrado público, etc. Las diferentes colinas permiten la visión del paisaje desde diferentes angulaciones y alturas. Los distintos usos asignados a cada colina son:   Plaza del agua: En esta colina el agua es el punto de atención. Desde aquí puedes hacerte una visión global del parque, además es un magnífico punto de reunión para diversas actividades. Es la única zona con pavimento duro del parque (pero con criterios de drenaje urbano sostenible).  Bosque de los sentidos: Sus caminos están enmarcados por amebas ajardinadas que llevan a distintas áreas de juego:  Área de integración: Pensada para estimular los sentidos, fomentar el ejercicio físico, la creatividad y la fantasía, además de facilitar el desarrollo del equilibrio, la motricidad y la coordinación, favoreciendo la inclusividad plena de todos los niños sin importar sus capacidades físicas o intelectuales, para que todos jueguen y se relacionen en un mismo entorno.  Zona de aventura: Aprovechando la zona de más desnivel del árbol se diseñan zonas de toboganes, tirolinas y juego multiaventura con forma de bambú gigante.  Zona de los sentidos: Espacio dedicado a juegos infantiles para agudizar los sentidos: instrumentos musicales, juegos de tacto, sensoriales, de tacto, etc.  Árbol del agua: La forma del árbol de agua permanece en su zona acuática con aspecto de lago con unas formas muy geométricas, que evidencian por su diseño 6 plazas principales bordeando todo el árbol: 3 de ellas son eminentemente paisajísticas, recreando en cada plaza un aspecto similar al de jardín japonés, sobrio y elegante y las otras tres plazas tienen varios espacios para distintos usos: mesas de picnic, zonas de ejercicios para personas mayores, etc.  Ría central: Inicia su recorrido en una pequeña cascada próxima a la avenida Mayorazgo, con discurrir este – oeste y termina en un lago. Divide el espacio en dos zonas unidas por dos puentes peatonales y alrededor lleva un paseo con plantaciones de ribera de arbolado y arbustivas.  Colina sobre ruedas: Espacio destinado a distintas prácticas deportivas asociadas a ruedas: bicicletas, skate, etc.  Colina del reciclaje: Los neumáticos que rodeaban el entorno han tomado forma de mobiliario en la búsqueda de aprender a valorar y cuidar lo que nos rodea y pertenece a todos; limpiar el paisaje; promover un modelo de gestión honesta y transparente de residuos y profundizar en el concepto de reutilización como forma creativa de relacionarnos con nuestros desechos. Esta colina pretende dar un valor único por las connotaciones educativas y los valores ambientales asociados a él, que son inexistentes en otros espacios lúdicos de la ciudad.  Zona de escalada: Adosada a la colina del reciclaje se ha proyectado un rocódromo con pared vertical con distintas alturas para la práctica de la escalada para distintas edades.  Zona de parkour: Situada junto a la zona de escalada.  Colina del viento: Espacio libre dedicado a los amantes del vuelo con cometas.  Mirador estelar: Su función es múltiple, pretende ser un punto de encuentro y por otro en el extremo más al sur, pueda observarse el cielo vallecano.  Área deportiva: En una zona verde el espacio donde disfrutar del deporte no debe faltar. Se ha orientado a varias prácticas y varias edades aprovechando el espacio sobre la cubierta del estanque de tormentas: zona de entrenamiento y pistas multideportes.  Zona canina: Situada sobre el estanque de tormentas, alberga una zona amplia para entrenamiento canino.
